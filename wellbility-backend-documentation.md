## Schema Definition

The `ConsentForm.js` file utilizes Mongoose to define a schema for consent forms. It leverages the `mongoose.Schema` class to model what a consent form document should look like in the MongoDB database. This schema includes various fields that capture the necessary information for consent forms related to vaccinations.

## Schema Fields

Below is a detailed list of the fields defined in the `ConsentFormSchema`, along with their types and descriptions:

| **Field Name**                  | **Type**                | **Required** | **Description**                                                          |

## Plugins Used

### `mongoosePaginate`

- **Description**: The `mongoose-paginate-v2` plugin is integrated into the schema to add pagination capabilities. This allows efficient querying of large datasets by breaking down the data into manageable chunks.

## Export

The schema is exported using `module.exports` to be used elsewhere in the application. It allows other parts of the application to interact with the `ConsentForm` model to perform CRUD operations on the consent form documents.

```javascript
module.exports = mongoose.model('ConsentForm', ConsentFormSchema);
```

## Conclusion

The `ConsentForm.js` file plays a crucial role in modeling the data structure for consent forms within the application. It ensures that all necessary fields are included and provides a framework for interacting with this data in a structured and consistent manner. This schema is integral to managing health-related information and supporting the overall functionality of the backend system. 🏫💉

### Schema Definition

The `MedicalProfessionalSchema` defines the structure of a Medical Professional document in MongoDB.

| Field                  | Type                    | Description                                      | Required |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `username`             | `String`                | Unique identifier for the medical professional.  | Yes      |
| `password`             | `String`                | Hashed password for authentication.              | Yes      |
| `email`                | `String`                | Unique email address for communication.          | Yes      |
| `resetPasswordToken`   | `String`                | Token for password reset functionality.          | No       |
| `resetPasswordExpires` | `String`                | Expiry time for the password reset token.        | No       |
| `phn`                  | `Schema.Types.ObjectId` | Reference to a PHN (Public Health Nurse) object. | Yes      |

```javascript
const MedicalProfessionalSchema = new Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  resetPasswordToken: { type: String },
  resetPasswordExpires: { type: String },
  phn: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'PHN', required: true },
});
```

---

### Middleware

The schema includes pre-save middleware to hash the password whenever it is modified. This enhances security by storing only hashed passwords in the database.

```javascript
MedicalProfessionalSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
  if (this.isModified('password')) {
    this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 8);
  }
  next();
});
```

- **Pre-save Middleware:** Automatically hashes the password before saving the document if the password field is modified.

---

### Instance Methods

An instance method `comparePassword` is provided to compare a plain text password with the hashed password stored in the database.

```javascript
MedicalProfessionalSchema.methods.comparePassword = async function (password) {
  return bcrypt.compare(password, this.password);
};
```

- **comparePassword:** Compares a given password with the stored hashed password, using bcrypt for comparison.

```javascript
const UserSchema = new Schema(
  {
    username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    password: { type: String, required: true },
    role: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Role' },
    school: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'School', required: false }],
    district: [
      { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'District', required: false },
    ],
    resetPasswordToken: { type: String },
    resetPasswordExpires: { type: String },
    isDeleted: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  },
  { timestamps: true },
);
```

## Plugins 🔌

### Pagination

The `mongoose-paginate-v2` plugin is applied to the schema to enable pagination functionality:

```javascript
UserSchema.plugin(mongoosePaginate);
```

## Methods 🔍

### comparePassword

A method for comparing a candidate password with the stored hashed password. It uses `bcrypt.compare` to ensure secure password verification.

```javascript
UserSchema.methods.comparePassword = function (candidatePassword) {
  return bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, this.password);
};
```

## Export 📤

The file exports the **User** model, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

```javascript
module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

## Summary 📝

The **User.js** file is crucial for handling user data and authentication within the Wellbility State School Backend. By leveraging mongoose for schema definitions and bcryptjs for password security, it ensures robust user management. The integration of pagination further enhances data handling capabilities, making it a well-rounded component of the system.

# Documentation for `PublicLinkController.js`

This file is part of the backend system for the Wellbility State School, implemented using Node.js and Express. It defines a controller for managing public links associated with consent forms, facilitating secure access and interaction between parents and the school system.

## Overview

The `PublicLinkController` handles the creation and management of public links that are used to share consent forms with parents. This controller ensures that each link is unique and has an expiration time, enhancing security and data integrity.

## Functions

### 1. Generate a Random Link

```javascript
const generateLink = () => {
  return crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
};
```

- **Purpose**: Generates a unique, random string using the `crypto` module. This link is used as the identifier in the URL for accessing the consent form.
- **Usage**: Internally used within the controller to ensure each public link is unique.

### 2. Create a Public Link

```javascript
exports.createPublicLink = async (req, res) => { ... }
```

- **Purpose**: Handles the creation of a public link for a given parent and consent form. The link is valid for 24 hours.
- **Parameters**:
  - `req.body.parentId`: The ID of the parent for whom the link is being created.
  - `req.body.consentFormId`: The ID of the consent form to be shared.
- **Process**:
  1. **Validation**: Checks if the parent and consent form exist.
  2. **Link Reuse**: Searches for an existing non-expired link. If found, returns this link instead of creating a new one.
  3. **Link Creation**: If no valid link exists, a new link is generated with a 24-hour expiry.
  4. **Database Updates**: Saves the new link in the `PublicLink` collection and associates it with the parent.
  5. **Email Notification**: Sends an email to the parent with the newly created link.
- **Response**:
  - **Success**: Returns the public link object with a status of `201 Created`.
  - **Errors**: Handles errors by returning a `500 Internal Server Error` with an error message.

## Dependencies

- **Models**:
  - `PublicLink`: Manages the public link data.
  - `Parent`: Represents the parent entity, maintaining a list of associated public links.
  - `ConsentForm`: Represents the consent form entity linked with the public link.
- **Utilities**:
  - **Crypto**: Used for generating a random hash for the link.
  - **SendGrid Config**: Utilized for sending email notifications to parents.

## Code Snippet

Here is the complete function for creating a public link, which includes validation, creation, and email notification:

```javascript
exports.createPublicLink = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { parentId, consentFormId } = req.body;
    const parent = await Parent.findById(parentId);
    const consentForm = await ConsentForm.findById(consentFormId);

    if (!parent || !consentForm) {
      return res
        .status(404)
        .json({ message: 'Parent or ConsentForm not found' });
    }

    const existingLink = await PublicLink.findOne({
      parentId,
      consentFormId,
      expiryTime: { $gt: new Date() },
    });
    if (existingLink) {
      return res.status(200).json(existingLink);
    }

    const link = generateLink();
    const expiryTime = new Date();
    expiryTime.setHours(expiryTime.getHours() + 24);

    const publicLink = new PublicLink({
      parentId,
      consentFormId,
      link,
      expiryTime,
    });
    await publicLink.save();

    parent.links.push(publicLink._id);
    await parent.save();

    const templateId = 'd-886de40787e44f95ab43e7e5e4b54f33';
    const data = { publicLink: link };
    await sendToParent(parent.email, templateId, data);

    res.status(201).json(publicLink);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error creating public link', error });
  }
};
```

## Conclusion

The `PublicLinkController.js` efficiently manages the lifecycle of public links, ensuring secure and temporary access to sensitive information like consent forms. The integration with email services ensures that parents are promptly notified, enhancing the communication process within the school system.

# Documentation for `authMiddleware.js`

The `authMiddleware.js` is a middleware module designed to handle authentication in an Express.js application using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes by verifying the JWT provided in the request headers.

## 📝 File Overview

- **Filename**: authMiddleware.js
- **Purpose**: To authenticate and authorize users by verifying JWT tokens in incoming requests.

## 📑 Key Features

- **Token Extraction**: Extracts the token from the request `Authorization` header.
- **Token Verification**: Verifies the token using `jsonwebtoken` to ensure it is valid and not expired.
- **Database Check**: Confirms the token exists in the database and has not expired.
- **User Authentication**: Attaches the decoded user information to the request object for downstream middleware and route handlers.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful responses in case of missing, invalid, or expired tokens.

## 📜 Code Explanation

Here is a breakdown of the code and its functionality:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const Token = require('../models/Token');

const verifyToken = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Get the token from the request headers
    const authorizationHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
    if (!authorizationHeader) {
      return res
        .status(401)
        .json({ status: 401, message: 'Access Denied. No token provided.' });
    }

    // Extract the token from the Bearer scheme
    const token = authorizationHeader.split(' ')[1];

    // Verify the token
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);

    // Check if the token exists in the database and is still valid
    const tokenDocument = await Token.findOne({ token: token });
    if (!tokenDocument || new Date() > tokenDocument.expires) {
      return res
        .status(401)
        .json({ status: 401, message: 'Invalid token or token has expired.' });
    }

    // Attach the decoded user information to the request object
    req.user = decoded;

    // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors that occur during token verification
    console.error('Token verification error:', error);
    return res.status(400).json({ status: 400, message: 'Invalid token.' });
  }
};

module.exports = verifyToken;
```

### 🛠️ Functionality

1. **Token Extraction**:

   - The middleware checks for an `Authorization` header in the incoming request. If not found, it responds with a `401 Access Denied` message.

2. **Token Splitting**:

   - It splits the header value to extract the token, assuming it's in the format `Bearer <token>`.

3. **Verification**:

   - The token is verified using `jsonwebtoken` and a secret key (`process.env.JWT_SECRET`).

4. **Database Validation**:

   - It checks if the token exists in the database (using a Mongoose model `Token`) and ensures it's not expired.

5. **Request Augmentation**:

   - If the token is valid, it attaches the decoded token data to the `req.user`, allowing subsequent middleware and routes to access user information.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - If any step fails (missing token, invalid token, expired token), appropriate HTTP status codes and messages are returned.

## 🚀 Usage

- **Importing**: This middleware should be imported and used in your routes where authentication is necessary.

```javascript
const verifyToken = require('./middlewares/authMiddleware');

// Use it as a middleware in your routes
app.get('/protected-route', verifyToken, (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route');
});
```

## 🔐 Security

- **JWT Secret**: Ensure that you set a strong and secure JWT secret in your environment variables (`process.env.JWT_SECRET`).
- **Token Expiry**: Regularly check and enforce token expiry to enhance security.

## ⚠️ Error Handling

- **401 Unauthorized**: Returned if no token is provided or the token is invalid or expired.
- **400 Bad Request**: Returned if there is a general error in token verification.

This middleware is crucial for securing routes in your application, ensuring that only authenticated users gain access to protected resources.

# `server.js` Documentation 📄🚀

The `server.js` file is the entry point for the "Wellbility State School Backend" application. It sets up the Express server, connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, configures middleware, and defines the basic routes for the application. Below is a detailed breakdown of its components and functionalities.

## Table of Contents

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Environment Configuration](#environment-configuration)
3. [Middleware Setup](#middleware-setup)
4. [Database Connection](#database-connection)
5. [Routes Configuration](#routes-configuration)
6. [Starting the Server](#starting-the-server)

## Overview

The `server.js` file initializes an Express application and configures it to connect to a MongoDB database. It also sets up middleware for handling JSON requests, CORS for cross-origin resource sharing, and includes routing for various endpoints.

## Environment Configuration

```javascript
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();
```

- **dotenv**: Used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. This allows sensitive information, such as database URLs and server ports, to be kept out of the source code.

## Middleware Setup

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json({ limit: '50mb' }));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ limit: '50mb', extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors({ origin: '*' }));
```

- **Body Parser**: Handles JSON and URL-encoded data with a size limit of 50mb, which is useful for handling large payloads.
- **CORS**: Configured to allow requests from any origin, which is important for developing applications that might be accessed from different domains.

## Database Connection

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose
  .connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL, {
    serverApi: { version: '1', strict: true, deprecationErrors: true },
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Connected to MongoDB using Mongoose!');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', error);
  });
```

- **Mongoose**: Connects to MongoDB using a URL provided in the environment variables. The connection is configured to use the latest server API version for better compatibility and error handling.

## Routes Configuration

```javascript
const authRoutes = require('./routes/auth');
const indexRouter = require('./routes/index');

app.use('/api', indexRouter);
app.use('/auth', authRoutes);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello New World!');
});
```

- **Auth Routes**: Handles authentication-related endpoints like login and registration.
- **Index Router**: Includes various application routes, organized for easier management.
- **Root Route**: A simple endpoint that returns a greeting message to verify that the server is running.

## Starting the Server

```javascript
app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${process.env.PORT}`);
});
```

- **Port Configuration**: The server listens on a port specified in the environment variables, allowing it to be easily changed without modifying the code.

This setup provides a robust foundation for running the backend server, handling HTTP requests, and managing data interactions with a MongoDB database. 🚀🌐
